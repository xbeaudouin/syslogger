NAME
     syslogger -- make entries in the system log

SYNOPSIS
     syslogger [-46Ai] [-h host] [-p pri] [-t tag]

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogger utility provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3)
     system log module.

     The following options are available:

     -4      Force syslogger to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Force syslogger to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      By default, syslogger tries to send the message to only one 
             address, if the host has more than one A or AAAA record. If this
             option is specified, logger tries to send the message to all
             addresses.

     -i      Log the process id of the logger process with each line.

     -h host
             Send the message to the remote system host instead of logging it
             locally.

     -p pri  Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may
             be specified numerically or as a ``facility.level'' pair.  For
             example, ``-p local3.info'' logs the message(s) as informational
             level in the local3 facility.  The default is ``user.notice.''

     -t tag  Mark every line in the log with the specified tag.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The logger utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
