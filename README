SYSLOGGER
---------

What is syslogger ?

This a software that send file into syslog (local or remote).
This can be used for example to send a pipe like for example apache
log into a remote system.

Why syslogger ?

Because I wanted a simple releable way to remote log lots of webservers
to a central point with the possiblity to have a central point of logging
with the problem of connected stream system (eg mod_sql for apache that
don't support the remote database is down).
There is on most Unix OS an utility named logger, but it has some problems
to use with real time applications : it waits the whole buffer to be
filed before sending it on syslog. So it is unusable for such applications.

How is developped syslogger ?

It is developped on Mac OS X and FreeBSD, it should work with allmost
system that have syslog and bsd/unix base.

License of syslogger ?

Simple : Mozilla Public License 1.1 (eg MPL 1.1), but some parts of the
code are comming from FreeBSD logger that I have adapted to this software.

What else ?

If you find this software please tell me. Send me money (using my paypal 
account) or anything else.
